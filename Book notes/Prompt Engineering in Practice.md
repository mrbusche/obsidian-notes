When dealing with long inputs, several strategies can be employed, such as truncation, summarization, and segmentation. Truncation involves removing less crucial portions of the input or output while retaining the most relevant information. Summarization, on the other hand, condenses lengthy inputs or conversations to focus on the essential points. Segmentation splits longer prompts or conversations into smaller, manageable segments and processes them separately, combining or aggregating the results later.

Key principles for each prompt element
**Instructions**: Craft clear, concise, and actionable instructions that define the task for the language model. Use specific language and avoid ambiguity. Context: Incorporate relevant background information and context to help the model understand the domain, scope, and purpose of the task.

**Input Parameters**: Utilize input placeholders to create flexible and reusable prompt templates. Place inputs strategically within the prompt to maintain clarity and coherence.

**Output Format**: Specify the desired structure and presentation of the generated content using patterns like the Output Indicator, Template Pattern, or Output Style and Tone.

**Constraints**: Apply targeted constraints to refine and control various aspects of the model's output, such as length, style, and tone. Ensure that the constraints align with the overall task and are clear and specific.

**Delimiters**: Use clear and distinguishable delimiters to separate and organize different prompt components, making it easier for the language model to process instructions and context.
