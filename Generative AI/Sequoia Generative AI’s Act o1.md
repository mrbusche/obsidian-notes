## Sequoia Generative AI's Act o1

[https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ais-act-o1/](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ais-act-o1/)

- true general reasoning capabilities with inference-time compute, meaning the model is asked to stop and think before providing a response (System 2) vs pre-trained instinctual responses (System 1)

- System 2 (deeper, deliberate reasoning) thinking

- The o1 paper has opened up an entire new plane for scaling compute: the more inference-time (or “test-time”)  compute you give the model, the better it reasons.

- What happens when the model can think for hours? Days? Decades? Will we solve the Riemann Hypothesis? Will we answer Asimov’s last question?
