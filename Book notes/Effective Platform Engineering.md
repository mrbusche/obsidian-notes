We define effective platform engineering as a craft:
- Composed of the architectural, engineering, and product delivery disciplines Applied by dedicated, development teams with broad domain knowledge and product ownership
- Delivered as an engineering platform that provides internal software development teams access to the tools and technologies they need to innovate, create, release, and operate their software
- Providing self-service and seamless access to all platform functions
- Minimizing the need for non-development tasks, and cross-team engineering delays
- Decreasing the cognitive load required to meet all security, governance and compliance
- Succeeding as measured by clear business goals that can be regularly reported against with observable metrics
