**Question-answering**: Also known as FAQ bots, these AI solutions deliver a response directly to a user’s question, usually without any follow-up.

We assume that you have some fundamental understanding of conversational AI technology. Those fundamentals include:

- Designing for the users’ needs (what success means for them)
- Designing for your business’ needs (what success means for you)
- Training your AI to understand the terminology of your users
- Testing the AI dialogue flows for accuracy and completeness

We looked for ways to reduce the complexity in this flow. Our research revealed that a majority of callers only had one claim for any particular member + date combination. In other words, a search on that information alone would often produce a single result. This meant that collecting a claim number was unnecessary for most users. Figure 8.2 shows the updated claim search flow, which collects the minimal amount of information to perform a claim search. If only one claim is found, the claim status is delivered immediately. If the logic detects more than one claim, the bot will disambiguate by collecting the claim number from the user.
