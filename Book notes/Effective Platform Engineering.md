We define effective platform engineering as a craft:
- Composed of the architectural, engineering, and product delivery disciplines Applied by dedicated, development teams with broad domain knowledge and product ownership
- Delivered as an engineering platform that provides internal software development teams access to the tools and technologies they need to innovate, create, release, and operate their software
- Providing self-service and seamless access to all platform functions
- Minimizing the need for non-development tasks, and cross-team engineering delays
- Decreasing the cognitive load required to meet all security, governance and compliance
- Succeeding as measured by clear business goals that can be regularly reported against with observable metrics

It is often the case that Enterprises struggle to know which development efforts are returning value, which have the greatest potential for value, versus those that are merely routine maintenance. It is not unusual for a large enterprise to first create a digital division, sometimes even as a whole new company, in which to gather the strategically valuable work and invest there in PE.

the essential principles of platform engineering, which include observability, continuous deployment, self-service functionality, compliance and governance, cost and sustainability, and security.

Observability, on the other hand, is about being proactive. It achieves that through its inherent nature of using inferences to develop insights and actions to ensure your end users do not experience the issues.

Developer Experience (DevEx) refers to the techniques and tools used to improve software developers' experience in developing and deploying their software. This scope covers setting up the development environment, provisioning the resources, writing the code, building it, testing it, and deploying it to various environments, including the production environment, in a secure, scalable, and observable manner. The goal of DevEx is not only to improve the experience but also to measure the improvements and achieve the targets needed for organizational success through reduced developer friction.

the fact that using AI will make good developers better and more productive is inevitable

Platform engineering teams are software engineering teams that deliver internal products to stakeholders and users throughout the organization.

Platform engineering requires a strategic approach with a product mindset to differentiate it from developing automation that can improve productivity

The most significant impact of Generative AI will be in testing, where it can automate test case generation, anomaly detection, and root cause analysis.

If the expectation is that the legacy silos can remain and behave in legacy ways while we somehow wrap an engineering platform around them, you will not succeed. If that were possible, adding the DevOps team would have been the solution. But it's not about creating a wrapper; it's about introducing a whole new way of working.

An engineering platform needs to evolve based on actual customer usage from the very start. In product development terms, this means identifying the minimum valuable version of the product and releasing that first.

“A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that works.” - John Gall

To recall, what the authors are talking about here is that when faced with difficult technology decisions, we should always make the choice that is easiest to change later. This is true for building products and extremely true for building engineering platforms

RE: Congnitive load - Arguably, one of the earliest works in this space came from Gerald M. Weinberg in his landmark book, The Psychology of Computer Programming published in 1971

**Why reduce cognitive load?**
- As organizations begin to measure cognitive load and its impacts, it's important to clearly understand what aspects of cognitive load can be measured. Recent research in the developer experience (DX) field has identified two additional key areas to focus on: feedback loops and flow state.
- Feedback loops in software development are essential for quick and high-quality responses to actions taken. They help developers get input, evaluate it, and adjust their work accordingly. These loops include not just functional testing of code, but also code reviews, performance feedback, stakeholder input, and retrospectives at the end of each sprint. Efficient development depends on fast feedback loops, which allow tasks to be completed smoothly and quickly. Slow feedback loops can disrupt the development cycle, leading to frustration and delays. To improve efficiency, organizations should shorten feedback loops by optimizing development tools and processes, such as build and test procedures or the development environment.
- Flow state refers to a developer's complete absorption and enthusiasm in their work, resulting in intense focus and enjoyment. Experiencing flow regularly enhances productivity, innovation, and personal growth. Studies show that happy developers often produce higher-quality outcomes. Therefore, fostering conditions that promote flow is crucial for improving employee well-being and performance.

This focus on the culture goes to the critical message of Team Topologies (Skelton & Pais, 2019), which refers to creating four distinct types of team topologies, as shown below.

While we have described the concept of a platform team so far, it is also essential to understand what the original authors meant by the following terms.
- Stream-Aligned Teams: These teams are organized around a continuous flow of work aligned with a specific business or customer value stream. They have end-to-end responsibility for delivering and maintaining their product or service. 
- Enabling Teams: These teams help others by providing expertise and guidance in specialized areas like automated testing, security, or architecture. They work temporarily with stream-aligned teams to remove obstacles and build capability. 
- Complicated Subsystem Teams: These teams focus on highly specialized or technically complex areas of the system, requiring deep expertise that is difficult to distribute among other teams. They handle parts of the system that need particular attention due to their intricacy

RE: Implementing org changes - more fundamentally, "I need the rest of the software delivery supply chain (IT Operations, Security, Compliance, Business Operations, et al.) to become as mature in engineering practice as software development."
