The Cognitive Verifier Pattern is a powerful technique that improves the accuracy and relevance of responses generated by large language models. This pattern instructs the model to create additional questions to better understand the original query, thus establishing confidence in the model's abilities. It ensures that the model comprehends the input's intent, context, and rules to produce meaningful and accurate outputs. This method resembles asking clarifying questions in real-life situations. The cognitive aspect allows the model to ask questions, while the verifier component enables the model to process the answers and generate relevant outputs

The Flipped Interaction Pattern is a game-changer, transforming the large language model from a passive AI communicator to an active conversational partner. With this pattern, the large language model takes the initiative to ask the user the right questions until it better understands the context and provides an accurate response. This reversal of roles, where the large language model becomes the questioner and the user the responder, is the essence of the Flipped Interaction Pattern, offering a unique and powerful way to interact with large language models.
